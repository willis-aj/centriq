             * Looping-how we repeat code
             * 4 types of loops
             * -For loop used when you know in advance how many times you have to
             * run that block of code, number of times you run the code is called the count
             * -While loop used when we dont know how many times the code will the run
             * stops based on a condition (0-? times)
             * -DoWhile loop runs based on condition as well but it must run at least once
             * really good for menus
             * -Foreach loop specilized loop  designed to work with collections, tell it what
             * to do and it will do it with each thing in the collection. (THESE ARE READ ONLY
             * meaning they do not modify things inside of the collection)
             * 
             * first 3 loops (foreach loop is different) have
             * counter-the starting point, a variable set at the starting point
             * condition-checks against the counter to determine if the loop should run
             * update-modifies the counter
             * 
             * how loop works
             * 
             * 
             * For loop syntax
             * for(counter;condition;update)
             * {
             *  //code to run
             * }
             * ex
             * running laps want to run a mile
             * for(intLaps=0; laps<4; laps++)
             * {
             *  Runlap();
             * }
             *
